## Summary

Shmphin is a Shared Memory Editor.
Like a hex editor, or binary editor.

If you know RWeverything, you can think of it as a shared memory version of RWeverything.

**This is a experimental project, and not all features are implemented yet.**

## Why Shmphin

- Shared memory is a common way to communicate between processes.
- Sometimes we need to check mapping manually.
- Sometimes we need to modify the bits in the shared memory.

## Not list

- GUI

## Parameters

### Priority
